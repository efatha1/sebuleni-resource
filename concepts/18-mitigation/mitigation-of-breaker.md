## Definition

Mitigation of a breaker is when price **retests the breaker zone** (the body of the originally-violated OB) and produces the new-polarity reaction the breaker setup expects. The mitigation event is what activates the breaker as a tradeable level — a breaker without retest is just a violated OB; a mitigation event with rejection-with-displacement turns it into a confirmed entry zone.

## Formal Criteria

For a bullish breaker (bull-side support after originally-bearish OB):

- Price retraces down into the breaker zone (the originally-bearish OB's body).
- Bullish reaction occurs (bullish wick rejection, FVG, or LTF MSS up).
- The mitigation is "successful" if displacement-up follows; if not, the breaker is failing ([failed-breaker](../08-breaker-blocks/failed-breaker.md)).

For a bearish breaker: symmetric.

## Formula / Math

```
breaker_mitigation(bb, retest_candle):
  if bullish_breaker:
    low(retest_candle) reaches into breaker_zone
    AND post-retest displacement is up
    AND optionally bullish_FVG forms
  if bearish_breaker:
    high(retest_candle) reaches into breaker_zone
    AND post-retest displacement is down
    AND optionally bearish_FVG forms
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   bullish breaker mitigation:

   originally bearish OB (1.0945-1.0955)
     ↓ violated UPWARD with bullish CHoCH
   ─── breaker zone (now bullish support) ───
                                          ↓ retest from above
                                          ▼ touches into 1.0950
                                          ▲▲▲ bullish reaction + FVG up
                                          → mitigation successful
```

## Timeframes

M15+.

## Examples

**Example 1 — successful bullish breaker mitigation:**
- Bullish breaker zone 1.0945–1.0955.
- H1 retraces; wicks 1.0948, prints bullish hammer-style candle, leaves bullish FVG up.
- → mitigation successful. Long entry on FVG retest.

## Common Mistakes

- **No-rejection touch.** A wick into the zone without rejection isn't a complete mitigation; wait for displacement direction.
- **Treating failure as mitigation-pending.** Once a close-through with opposite displacement happens, abandon the trade — see [failed-breaker](../08-breaker-blocks/failed-breaker.md).
