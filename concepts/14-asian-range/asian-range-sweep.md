## Definition

An Asian range sweep is the [liquidity-sweep](../02-liquidity/liquidity-sweep.md) of either the Asian range high or low at the start of the London session — typically inside the London Open killzone (02:00–05:00 NY) and frequently inside the 02:50–03:10 macro window. It is the canonical [judas-swing](../13-judas-swing/judas-swing.md) of the trading day. The sweep itself is a single-candle (or short-burst) wick through the bound, with the close back inside the range.

## Formal Criteria

For a high-side sweep:

- Price wicks above asian_range_high.
- The candle (or one of the next 1–2 candles) closes back below asian_range_high.
- Long upper wick relative to candle range.

For a low-side sweep: symmetric.

The sweep is the manipulation phase ([manipulation-phase](../12-power-of-three/manipulation-phase.md)) in a daily AMD cycle. Post-sweep, expect displacement in the opposite direction (the true delivery).

## Formula / Math

```
high_side_sweep := high(n) > asian_range_high
                    AND close(n) < asian_range_high
                    AND wick_top_pct(n) >= 0.6

low_side_sweep := low(n) < asian_range_low
                   AND close(n) > asian_range_low
                   AND wick_bottom_pct(n) >= 0.6
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   high-side sweep                    low-side sweep
   asian_high ──┬────                       /  ← close back inside
                █  long wick                █
                █                           ─── asian_low
   ─ close back inside                      █
                                            █  long wick
```

## Timeframes

M1 / M5 / M15.

## Examples

**Example 1 — high-side sweep, bullish HTF (ambiguous read):**
- Asian range 1.0848–1.0876.
- HTF bias bullish.
- 02:55 NY (LO-KZ + macro): M5 wicks 1.0879, closes 1.0871. The high was swept and price closed back inside the range.
- This sweep is ambiguous given bullish HTF: it could be (a) a Judas-up + reversal-to-fakeout (bearish daily), OR (b) a brief fuel-grab before continuation up (run-and-continue).
- Confirmation needed: read the post-sweep displacement direction over the next 1–3 M5 candles. Strong upward displacement through 1.0879 with FVG → run-and-continue; strong downward displacement with bearish FVG → HTF bias may be wrong, or this is a counter-bias day.
- Lesson: high-side sweep on bullish HTF requires post-sweep confirmation before commitment.

**Example 2 — low-side sweep, bullish bias = textbook Judas:**
- Same range; HTF bullish.
- 02:55 NY: M5 wicks 1.0846 (Asian SSL), closes 1.0853.
- Bullish bias + low-side sweep = textbook Judas swing. Expect bullish displacement next.
- 03:05: M5 prints 18-pip green displacement, FVG at 1.0858. Entry zone confirmed.

## Common Mistakes

- **Sweep without bias context.** Any sweep is interpretable both ways (continuation vs reversal); HTF bias decides which.
- **Single-candle fixation.** Sweep can take 2–3 M5 candles to play out (push, hover, return). Defining feature is "broke the level, did not sustain it."
- **Trading the sweep instead of the post-sweep displacement.** Entry on the sweep wick gets stopped if it extends. Wait for the displacement direction confirmation.
