## Definition

OTE rules are the operational checklist for taking an OTE entry — the discipline that distinguishes a high-probability OTE from a low-probability fib-level fade. ICT teaches OTE not as "buy at 0.705" but as a **multi-condition checklist**.

> ⚠ **Checklist corrected 2026-08-05.** Items 5–7 previously described a *reversal* entry (lower-TF MSS confirming "the reversal"), a stop beyond 0.79, and standard-deviation targets. The reversal framing belongs to the [ict-2022-model](../31-models/ict-2022-model.md) and that correction stands. Corrections are quoted to primary sources below; items 1–4 are unchanged.
>
> ⚠ **Partly reversed 2026-08-09 — the 08-05 pass over-corrected on two of the three.** It read 3 OTE videos; the official channel carries 43, including a 20-part *OTE Pattern Recognition Series* of which only Vol. 01 had been read. On the fuller corpus, **SD targets and non-leg-origin stops are both ICT-original** and are restored as disclosed era-forks in items 6 and 7. Only the reversal-framing correction survives unchanged. Root cause was sample size, not method — the confident negatives ("none of the three", "no primary-source quote") were unsupportable from 3 of 43.

## Formal Criteria — The OTE Checklist

A valid OTE entry requires ALL of:

1. **HTF bias direction confirmed.** Long OTEs only on bullish bias; shorts only on bearish. *(Majority convention; ICT-original teaches the raw pattern bias-agnostically — "many times you don't even need a bias", `ICT-2020-OTE-VOL01`.)*
2. **Clean measured leg** (leg_start and leg_end are confirmed swing pivots) that **breaks a prior swing level in the trade direction** — short-term, intermediate-term, or the previous day's high/low. Intermediate-term breaks are "much much more reliable" (`ICT-2017-OTE`). ⚠ This is a **with-trend continuation break, not a counter-directional sweep.**
2b. **Fib anchored to candle bodies, not wicks** — the highest/lowest *body* of the terminal and origin swings (`ICT-2017-OTE`, 36:28; restated `ICT-2020-OTE-EURUSD-EXAMPLE`, 01:37). Wick-anchoring changes `leg_size` and therefore items 3, 6 and 7 below. See [fib-anchoring](../28-fibonacci-levels/fib-anchoring.md).
3. **Retracement enters [0.62, 0.79]** — the whole zone is tradable; no pixel precision.
4. **PD array at the entry level** (FVG / OB / breaker / mitigation). *(Shown in worked examples; not stated as a hard mandate in the dedicated material.)*
5. **Entry executed in the impulse direction** — a limit at the chosen depth, or a lower-TF confirmation inside the zone if the trader wants one. ⚠ Any lower-TF trigger here confirms **continuation**, not a reversal; OTE does not wait for structure to break *against* the impulse.
6. **Stop placement — a disclosed intra-primary fork.** **0.79 is the deepest entry, not the stop** in either branch.
   - **Primer branch (2017, definitional):** SL at the leg-origin extreme (fib 1.0), exactly — "my stop will be exactly at this low, not 10 pips [or] 5 to 10 pips below that" (`ICT-2017-OTE`).
   - **2020 applied branch:** a **fixed pip stop** sized to the setup, not to the leg. `ICT-2020-OTE-VOL01` (41:33) — "the stop would be 6430, so it's a 20 pip stop"; `ICT-2020-OTE-EURUSD-EXAMPLE` (02:50) — "using a 20 pip stop loss, that would put your stop just about in this high here, so you'd be able to withstand all of the expansion **beyond the 79% retracement level**". Recurs throughout the series: 10 pips (`ICT-2020-OTE-VOL02`, `ICT-2020-OTE-VOL10`, `ICT-2020-OTE-VOL15`, `ICT-2020-OTE-VOL19`), 30 pips (`ICT-2020-OTE-VOL20`).

   The Primer governs as the definitional video, but the fixed-pip branch is **ICT-original and explicitly not leg-origin** — the EURUSD quote places the stop past 0.79 by design. State which branch a backtest or implementation uses; they produce materially different R. *(Corrected 2026-08-09: this item previously asserted the tighter stop had "no primary-source quote behind it". That was wrong — two of the three videos the 2026-08-05 pass itself relied on contain fixed-pip stop quotes.)*
7. **Targets defined** — first partial at the prior extreme (fib 0.0), then an extension ladder; move the stop to 0.5 of the range after the first target (`ICT-2020-OTE-VOL01`). Optionally aligned with an HTF draw on liquidity. Two ladders are taught, and they are era-split:
   - **Primer ladder (2017):** −0.27 / −0.62 / −1.0 of the same leg (`ICT-2017-OTE`), the last being the symmetrical price swing.
   - **Standard-deviation ladder (2020 series):** half / full / one-and-a-half / two standard deviations of the fib range. `ICT-2020-OTE-VOL10` (01:39–02:00) walks the preset's own levels — "you can add a negative 1.5 level… so that way you have your half standard deviation, full standard deviation, one and a half standard deviation and two standard deviations". Used throughout `ICT-2020-OTE-VOL04`–`VOL09`, `VOL12`, `VOL15`. See [standard-deviation-projections](../28-fibonacci-levels/standard-deviation-projections.md).

   *(Corrected 2026-08-09: the 2026-08-05 pass removed SD targets on the grounds that "none … is what the dedicated OTE material teaches". The OTE Pattern Recognition Series is dedicated OTE material and teaches them across at least nine volumes; the earlier pass had read only Vol. 01 of 20.)*

Missing any of (1)–(6) significantly reduces conviction. (7) is for trade management; missing it doesn't invalidate the entry but does compromise execution.

⚠ **Disclosed conflict on R:R:** the Primer requires "better than two to one"; Vol.01 rejects an R:R requirement outright ("if it's one to one it's still good") and imposes a ≥15-pip first-scale floor instead. The Primer governs as the definitional video.

## Visual Pattern

```
   OTE entry checklist (bullish example):

   ☐ HTF bias bullish?                           [check D / W]
   ☐ Clean leg (start = LTL, end = recent LTH)?  [structural confirmation]
   ☐ Leg TOOK OUT a prior high on the way up?    [with-trend structure break]
   ☐ Fib anchored on BODIES, not wicks?          [anchoring — sets every level below]
   ☐ Retracement entered [0.62, 0.79]?           [fib measurement]
   ☐ FVG / OB / breaker at entry level?          [PD-array check]
   ☐ Entering LONG, with the impulse?            [NOT fading a sweep — that's the 2022 model]
   ☐ SL at the leg-origin low, exactly?          [risk control, fib 1.0]
   ☐ Targets 0.0 / -0.27 / -0.62 / -1.0, HTF DOL? [trade management]

   All checked → take the entry.
   Missing any of 1-6 → skip or reduce conviction.
```

## Timeframes

All TFs.

## Examples

**Example 1 — full checklist pass:**
- Daily bias bullish ✓.
- H1 leg 1.0800 → 1.0900, clean, and it **took out the prior short-term high** at 1.0885 on the way up ✓.
- Retracement reaches 1.0830 (0.705) ✓.
- M15 bullish FVG at 1.0828–1.0832 ✓.
- Entry long, with the impulse ✓ (no counter-sweep is being faded).
- **SL at 1.0800 — the leg-origin low, exactly** ✓. Risk = 30 pips.
- Targets: 1.0900 first partial (70 pips ≈ 2.3R), then 1.0927 / 1.0962 / 1.1000 ✓.
- → take the entry.

**Example 2 — checklist fails on PD array:**
- All conditions met EXCEPT no FVG/OB at the OTE level.
- → skip; entry has no algorithmic anchor. Wait for fresh structure.

## Common Mistakes

- **Skipping the leg-quality check.** Choppy "legs" produce unreliable retracement levels.
- **Skipping the entry trigger.** Pre-positioning at the fib level without a lower-TF confirmation candle invites SL hits on overshoots.
- **Force-fitting OTEs onto every chart.** Not every retracement is OTE-grade; some moves don't pull back into 0.62–0.79 at all (price runs without retest).
- ⚠ **Running the checklist on a counter-sweep setup.** If the trigger was a raid on the opposite side that you are now fading, you are trading the [ict-2022-model](../31-models/ict-2022-model.md), not OTE. Its criteria — and its FVG-at-CE entry — govern that trade.
- ⚠ **Stopping out at 0.79.** The taught invalidation is the leg origin. A 0.79 stop turns a ~2:1 setup into a much tighter one with a different failure profile; whatever its merits, it is not the rule ICT states.
