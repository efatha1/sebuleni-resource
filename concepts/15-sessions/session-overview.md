## Definition

ICT divides the 24-hour FX trading day into discrete sessions defined in **New York time** (EST/EDT). Sessions are not arbitrary — each one carries a characteristic delivery profile (accumulation, manipulation, expansion, distribution) that the algorithm uses repeatedly. ICT's broader killzone concept overlays specific sub-windows inside these sessions where the highest-probability setups occur (see [killzone-overview](../10-killzones/killzone-overview.md)). All times below are NY time and follow DST — see [dst-handling](../04-time-cycles/dst-handling.md).

## Formal Criteria

The ICT canonical session map (NY time, the times ICT uses most of the year):

| Session | Start | End | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Asia | 18:00 (prev day) | 03:00 | low volatility, range-building |
| London | 02:00 | 11:00 | high volatility, often sets daily direction |
| NY AM | 08:00 | 12:00 | major US news, NY Open displacement |
| NY Lunch | 12:00 | 13:30 | low volatility, consolidation |
| NY PM | 13:30 | 16:00 | secondary delivery, reversals common |
| London Close | 10:00 | 12:00 | overlaps NY AM; European book unwinds |

These times shift by one hour during the brief windows when NY DST and UK BST are misaligned (mid-March → late-March, and early-November → late-October). During those gaps, London and NY are 4 hours apart instead of the usual 5; ICT-times anchored to NY clock continue to work, but if you're translating from GMT/UTC charts, see [dst-handling](../04-time-cycles/dst-handling.md).

## Formula / Math

Session membership for any timestamp `t` (NY time):

```
session(t) :=
  if 18:00_prev_day <= t < 03:00:        Asia
  elif 02:00 <= t < 08:00:               London (early)
  elif 08:00 <= t < 12:00:               NY AM (overlaps London Close)
  elif 12:00 <= t < 13:30:               NY Lunch
  elif 13:30 <= t < 16:00:               NY PM
```

(Some ICT references treat 17:00 NY as the daily close; broker-dependent. See [dst-handling](../04-time-cycles/dst-handling.md) for the brief twice-yearly windows when these boundaries shift one hour relative to GMT/UTC.)

## Visual Pattern

```
NY time 24-hour layout (DST):

00 ──── 03 ──── 07 ── 09 ── 12 ── 13:30 ── 16 ──── 18 ──── 24
  Asia       London       NY AM    NY     NY PM       Asia
                          (overlap Lunch              (next
                           London Close)               day)
```

## Timeframes

Session boundaries are most relevant on M5 / M15 / H1; daily and higher TFs aggregate across sessions. Lower TFs (M1) show session transitions clearly but are noise-dominated.

## Examples

**Example 1 — full daily cycle:**
- Asia (18:00 prev → 03:00): EURUSD ranges 30 pips.
- London (03:00 → 08:00): sweeps Asian SSL, displaces 60 pips up.
- NY AM (08:00 → 12:00): continues with NY Open displacement candle, prints PDH.
- Lunch (12:00 → 13:30): tight 12-pip consolidation.
- NY PM (13:30 → 17:00): reversal back into NY AM range.

## Common Mistakes

- **Using broker time, not NY time.** Many brokers display server time (often GMT+2 / GMT+3); ICT analysis requires explicit NY-time conversion. DST mismatch is the #1 killzone error.
- **Treating session boundaries as hard.** Volatility transitions are gradual; the first/last 15 minutes of any session can behave like the adjacent one.
- **Ignoring overlaps.** NY AM and London Close overlap (10:00–12:00 NY); this overlap is the highest-volume window of the day.
