## Definition

London Close is the 10:00 → 12:00 NY window during which the European institutional book unwinds for the day. It overlaps the NY AM session and is one of the **highest-volume windows of the trading day** because both London and NY traders are active simultaneously. ICT teaches London Close as a window where European positions are squared — frequently producing reversals against the London-open direction (see [london-close-reversal](../31-models/london-close-reversal.md)).

## Formal Criteria

- Time window: 10:00 → 12:00 NY (canonical NY-time anchor).
- Overlaps NY AM (08:00 → 12:00) — high volume.
- Behavior: often a reversal of London-open's direction as European books unwind, OR an acceleration when NY agrees with London's direction.
- Window closes into NY Lunch — final London prints often coincide with NY AM-window peaks.

## Formula / Math

```
london_close_window = [10:00, 12:00] NY

overlaps with ny_am_window = [08:00, 12:00] NY     # 10:00–12:00 overlap
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   08:00 ── 10:00 ──────── 12:00 NY
                |          |
   NY AM ───────── ████████ ────  high-volume overlap
   London ────── ██████████ ───   (London close)
                |          |
                ↑          ↑
        London close      Lunch begins
        starts            (London closed,
                           NY continues)
```

## Timeframes

M5 / M15 / H1. The 10:00–11:00 NY window is also the **NY AM Silver Bullet** — these two ICT concepts overlap and reinforce each other.

## Examples

**Example 1 — London-close reversal:**
- London-open delivered a 60-pip rally on EURUSD; HOD 1.0925 set at 09:30 NY.
- 10:00–11:00 NY: M5 sweeps 1.0925 BSL, closes 1.0918.
- 11:30: M5 displaces 30 pips down, leaves bearish FVG.
- → London-close reversal; rest of NY AM trends back into Asian range.

## Common Mistakes

- **Confusing London close with London session close.** "London Close" in ICT means the 10:00–12:00 NY window where the close-out happens — not the moment London exchange physically closes.
- **Trading the overlap as one window.** London close (10–12) and NY AM Silver Bullet (10–11) overlap; the SB rules apply specifically to that hour, not to the full close window.
- **Ignoring DST.** London-close clock-time vs NY shifts twice a year; always anchor to NY clock.
