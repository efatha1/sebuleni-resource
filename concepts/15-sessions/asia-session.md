## Definition

The Asia session covers the overnight trading window from 18:00 NY (prev day) to 03:00 NY. It is characterized by **low volatility, range-building, and accumulation** — institutions are typically not delivering large directional moves during Asia. The Asian range that forms here (Asian high and Asian low) becomes a primary set of liquidity pools for the London open, which routinely sweeps one side as part of its [judas-swing](../13-judas-swing/judas-swing.md). DST nuances → [dst-handling](../04-time-cycles/dst-handling.md).

## Formal Criteria

- Time window: 18:00 NY (prev day) → 03:00 NY (canonical; minor shift during DST/BST mismatch windows — see [dst-handling](../04-time-cycles/dst-handling.md)).
- Volatility: typically the lowest of any session (ATR ~30–50% of London/NY ATR).
- Behavior: range-bound, overlapping candles, often produces equal highs and equal lows along the bounds.
- Output: an Asian range high (BSL pool) and Asian range low (SSL pool) that London targets.

## Formula / Math

```
asia_window = [18:00 NY prev day, 03:00 NY]    # canonical NY-time anchor

asian_high = max(high(t)) for t in asia_window
asian_low  = min(low(t))  for t in asia_window
asian_range = asian_high - asian_low
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   18:00 (prev) ────────────────── 03:00 (NY time)

   Asian high ────────────────────── ← BSL pool
                /\  /\
               /  \/  \   ← tight, overlapping
              /        \      candles
             /          \
   Asian low ───────────────────── ← SSL pool
```

## Timeframes

Most analysis uses M15 / H1 to identify the Asian range; M5 for the actual range bounds and equal-high / equal-low formation; H4 for context.

## Examples

**Example 1 — typical Asia → London setup:**
- Asia produces a 30-pip range on EURUSD: high 1.0875, low 1.0845.
- London opens at 03:00 NY; M5 wicks the Asian high (1.0879) and closes at 1.0871.
- → Asian BSL swept; Judas swing complete; long-bias setups now look for Asian-low SSL test or direct rally.

## Common Mistakes

- **Treating Asia as random noise.** The Asian range is *deliberately* engineered liquidity by accumulation-phase delivery; ignoring it loses one of the most reliable session-based reads.
- **Using server-time bounds.** If your charts are on GMT or broker time, the "Asia session" displayed will be offset; always anchor to NY time.
- **Trading Asia mean-reversion blindly.** Asian breakouts late in the session (last hour) sometimes signal continuation, not noise.
