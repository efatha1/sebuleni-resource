## Definition

A rejection block is a candle (or short cluster) characterized by a **strong wick rejection at a key level**, leaving a long wick relative to the body. The wick documents that price tried to go through a level and was forcibly rejected. Distinct from order blocks (which use the body), rejection blocks reference the **wick** as the key zone — the rejected portion is what becomes the future entry/SL anchor. Less standardized than OBs and FVGs; ICT teaches RBs as secondary references.

## Formal Criteria

A rejection block:

- A candle has a long wick on one side (≥ 60% of total candle range).
- The wick reaches a known key level (HTF swing, prior FVG/OB edge, round number, session extreme).
- Price rejects the wick extreme strongly (the close is far from the wick tip).
- Often combined with displacement on the next candle confirming the rejection.

For a **bullish** RB: long lower wick rejecting downward (price tried to go down, rejected up).
For a **bearish** RB: long upper wick rejecting upward (price tried to go up, rejected down).

## Formula / Math

```
range_n = high(n) - low(n)
body_n  = abs(close(n) - open(n))

# Bullish RB:
lower_wick = min(open(n), close(n)) - low(n)
is_bullish_rb := lower_wick >= 0.60 * range_n
                  AND wick reaches known key level
                  AND close near top of range

# Bearish RB: symmetric on upper wick
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   bullish rejection block:
          ▲
          █  ← close near top of range
          █
          █
        ▼     ← long lower wick (60%+ of range)
        ▼
        ▼
       (wick tip reaches key level)

   bearish RB: mirror.
```

## Timeframes

M15+. Lower TFs have noisy long wicks that aren't structurally meaningful.

## Examples

**Example 1 — bullish RB at PWL:**
- H1 candle: open 1.0865, close 1.0875, low 1.0848 (deep wick), high 1.0876.
- Lower wick = 0.0017 (17 pips); range = 0.0028 (28 pips); wick% = 60.7%.
- Wick tip 1.0848 = PWL (prior week low) SSL pool.
- Next H1: 22-pip green displacement; bullish FVG.
- → bullish rejection block at the PWL level. Long zone reference for future retests.

## Common Mistakes

- **Calling every long-wick candle "RB."** Without a key-level anchor, the long wick is just noise.
- **Confusing RB with sweep.** Liquidity sweeps and rejection blocks overlap heavily. RBs emphasize the resulting *zone* (the wick + body); sweeps emphasize the *event*.
- **Trading RB without confirmation.** Single-candle RB with no follow-through displacement is low-conviction.

> Confidence is `medium` because RB usage varies across the ICT community; many practitioners fold the concept into liquidity sweeps and OBs.
