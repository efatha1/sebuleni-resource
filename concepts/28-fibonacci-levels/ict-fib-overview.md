## Definition

ICT teaches a **specific subset of fibonacci ratios** for measured retracements and projections — not the full classical fib set used by other technical-analysis traditions. The ICT fib retracement set is **0.62 / 0.705 / 0.79** (the OTE zone), with 0.50 (equilibrium) and 0.79 as the deepest entry. The ICT fib projection set is **−1.5 / −2.0 / −2.5 / −4.0** standard-deviation levels (negative ratios indicate price extending beyond the measured leg). Other classical levels (0.382, 0.618 alone, 1.272, 1.618) are NOT primary ICT references.

## Formal Criteria

ICT fib levels:

| Type | Level | ICT name |
|---|---|---|
| Retracement | 0.50 | Equilibrium (EQ) |
| Retracement | 0.62 | upper OTE bound |
| Retracement | 0.705 | OTE optimal entry |
| Retracement | 0.79 | lower OTE bound (deep entry) |
| Projection | -1.5 | first SD target |
| Projection | -2.0 | second SD target |
| Projection | -2.5 | third SD target |
| Projection | -4.0 | extreme SD target |

The fib tool is anchored to a **measured swing leg**: from leg start to leg end. Retracements measure pullback into the leg; projections measure extensions beyond the leg's destination.

⚠ **The anchors are candle-body extremes, not wick extremes** — "we want to look at the price move on the bodies of the candles… the wicks are always going to be the thinnest price action" (`ICT-2017-OTE`). Because every level below is computed from `leg_size`, this choice propagates into the whole set. See [fib-anchoring](fib-anchoring.md).

## Formula / Math

```
leg_start = body extreme at start of measured leg    # see fib-anchoring
leg_end   = body extreme at end of measured leg      # NOT the wick extreme
leg_size  = leg_end - leg_start          # signed by direction

retrace(level) = leg_end - level * leg_size
project(level) = leg_end - level * leg_size  # works the same with negative levels

# Example, bullish leg from 1.0800 (start) to 1.0900 (end):
EQ_0_50 = 1.0900 - 0.50 * 100 = 1.0850
OTE_0_705 = 1.0900 - 0.705 * 100 = 1.08295
OTE_0_79 = 1.0900 - 0.79 * 100 = 1.0821
SD_-1_5  = 1.0900 - (-1.5) * 100 = 1.1050
SD_-2_0  = 1.0900 + 200 = 1.1100
```

## Visual Pattern

```
   bullish leg (start → end, then retracement):

   leg_end ─────────  ← 0.0 (no retracement)
                                  ── -1.5 SD projection target
                                  ── -2.0
                                  ── -2.5
                                  ── -4.0
   ─── 0.50 (EQ) ────
   ─── 0.62 (upper OTE) ─
   ─── 0.705 (OTE optimal entry) ───
   ─── 0.79 (deep OTE) ─
   leg_start ─────────  ← 1.0 (full retrace)
```

## Timeframes

All TFs.

## Examples

**Example 1 — bullish leg + OTE entry:**
- Leg: 1.0800 → 1.0900 (100 pips bullish).
- OTE zone: 0.62 = 1.08380, 0.705 = 1.08295, 0.79 = 1.0821.
- Long entry at 0.705 (1.08295) on retest with bullish FVG + HTF bias.
- SL below 0.79 (1.0821) plus buffer.
- Targets: -1.5 SD = 1.1050 (extension), -2.0 SD = 1.1100.

## Common Mistakes

- **Using classical fib set.** 0.382, 0.50, 0.618, 1.272, 1.618 are common but NOT ICT's primary set. Use 0.62 / 0.705 / 0.79 / SD ratios instead.
- **Anchoring poorly.** Anchor to a clean swing leg with structural significance (a confirmed swing high to swing low, not a random pivot).
- **Anchoring to wicks.** Charting tools snap to high/low by default; ICT anchors to candle bodies. See [fib-anchoring](fib-anchoring.md).
- **Ignoring HTF.** Fib levels alone are not entries; require PD-array + HTF confluence at the level.
