## Definition

The Commitment of Traders report is a **weekly CFTC release** breaking futures
positioning into three participant classes. ICT reads it for one thing: what the
**commercials** — the hedgers with a physical or balance-sheet interest — are doing,
because their net position reveals whether the market is in an accumulation
("buy program") or distribution ("sell program") phase at the macro scale.

It is a **higher-time-frame bias input**, not a signal: commercials net long for six
months "doesn't mean you just buy — there's other things you have to look at… but by
itself it means that they are in a **buy program**" (`ICT-2017-COT`, 07:41).

## Formal Criteria

- **Futures positions only.** ICT ignores the options side entirely: "I look at only
  the futures positions" (01:53).
- **Read the commercial column** — the centre column of the report (02:01).
- **Net position = long contracts − short contracts.** Positive is net long, negative
  net short (02:32).
- **Zero line is the phase boundary:** commercials above it = **buy program**; below it
  = **sell program** (08:48).
- **Lookback is 12 to 6 months** — "we look back a year to see what they've done" —
  recording the highest and lowest net long reading *above* the zero line and the
  highest and lowest net short reading *below* it (08:13–08:41). Current positioning is
  judged against that year's own range, not against an absolute number.
- **Duration matters:** commercials net long "for over six months" marks a macro buy
  program rather than a passing hedge (07:34).
- Commercials also run **hedging programs** inside a buy program — selling some while
  accumulating — so short bursts against the net position are expected (08:03, 08:52).
- **Recentred zero line (refinement, `ICT-2017-EXPLOSIVE-MARKETS`, 15:18–16:28).** When the
  COT is used to qualify a specific trade, ICT **discards the printed zero line** and
  builds his own: take the commercial line's **highest and lowest readings over the last 12
  months, divide that range in half, and treat the midpoint as the bull/bear boundary** —
  "I ignore the zero line on the standard net trader position chart". A market whose
  commercials sat below the absolute zero line all year can still be **buying aggressively**
  by this measure, which is exactly the case the refinement exists to catch.

## Formula / Math

```
net_commercial(t) := commercial_long(t) - commercial_short(t)     # futures only

phase(t) := BUY_PROGRAM  if net_commercial(t) > 0
            SELL_PROGRAM if net_commercial(t) < 0

# Judged against the market's OWN 12-month range, not an absolute level:
band_above := [min(net > 0 over 12m), max(net > 0 over 12m)]
band_below := [min(net < 0 over 12m), max(net < 0 over 12m)]

# Recentred boundary used when qualifying a trade (ICT-2017-EXPLOSIVE-MARKETS):
band_hi   := max(net_commercial over 12m)
band_lo   := min(net_commercial over 12m)
zero_new  := (band_hi + band_lo) / 2          # replaces the printed zero line
phase(t)  := BUY_PROGRAM if net_commercial(t) > zero_new else SELL_PROGRAM

# Worked example (ICT-2017-COT, 02:36-02:49), Japanese yen:
#   commercial long - commercial short = +67,024 contracts  -> net long
```

No numeric threshold for "extreme" is taught. The read is positional within the
year's range, and discretionary — the recentred midpoint is the only boundary ICT
computes rather than reads off the chart.

## Visual Pattern

```
   Net Traders Position line chart (plotted beneath price):

     +  ┤        ╱‾‾‾‾╲            commercials  = RED
        │   ╱‾‾‾╱      ╲           large traders = GREEN
     0  ┼──╱──────────────╲─────   small specs   = BLUE
        │                  ╲___
     -  ┤

   Commercials above the zero line for 6+ months  -> buy program
   Commercials below the zero line                -> sell program
   Position is read against that market's OWN 12-month high/low band.

   RECENTRED BOUNDARY (when qualifying a trade):
     +  ┤
        │   ╱‾‾‾╲                          band_hi
     0  ┼────────────────────────────────  printed zero  (IGNORED)
        │ ══════════════════════════════   zero_new = (band_hi + band_lo) / 2
        │      ╲___╱‾‾╲___╱‾               band_lo
     -  ┤
   Commercials can sit below the printed zero all year and still be BUYING
   once they cross above the recentred midpoint.

## Timeframes

Weekly and monthly only — the report is released weekly and describes macro
positioning. It has no intraday application.

## Examples

**Example 1 — Japanese yen net position (`ICT-2017-COT`, 01:41–02:49):**
- Open the yen COT report, futures section, commercial column.
- Long minus short = **+67,024 contracts** → commercials net long.
- Above the zero line, so the market is in a commercial buy program.

**Example 2 — duration read (07:34–07:46):**
- Commercials have held a net long position for over six months.
- That marks a macro buy program; it is not by itself an instruction to buy.

## Common Mistakes

- **Including options positions.** ICT reads futures only.
- **Reading large or small speculators as the signal.** They are plotted for contrast
  (green and blue); the commercial line (red) is the one that carries the read.
- **Treating an absolute contract count as extreme.** Extremity is relative to that
  market's own 12-month band.
- **Trading it directly.** COT is macro context; it supplies no entry, stop, or target.
- **Reading a hedging burst as a phase change.** Commercials sell inside a buy program
  by design.
- **Using the printed zero line when qualifying a trade.** The recentred 12-month midpoint
  is the boundary ICT actually acts on; the printed line can label an accumulating market
  bearish for a full year.
